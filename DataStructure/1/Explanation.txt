According to k, i.e., k-ary Tree, a children of each node will increase by k:
    1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1) <= n
    (k^m - 1) / (k - 1) <= n
    k^m <= n * (k - 1) + 1, because k >= 2
    m >= log_k (n * (k - 1) + 1)

Neglecting constants, we know the height of k-ary tree is log_k (n).
By inserting and removing function, the k_heap will be restored with upHeap() and downHeap().
So, the running time will be log_k (n) time.
